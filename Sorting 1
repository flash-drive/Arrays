## Insertion Sort ##

Insertion works by dividing an array into two halves; a sorted half on the left and an 
unsorted half on the right. It works by:

1) Designating the leftmost element of A as the only element of the sorted side
2) Insert the first element from the unsorted side into the sorted side, increasing the
number of sorted elements by one.
3) Repeat step two until there are no unsorted elements left.

Worst case scenario for insertion sort is ((n-1)(n))/2
Best case scenario for insertion sort is n-1
